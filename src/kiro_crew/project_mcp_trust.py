"""Per-directory consent for a project's own MCP servers on mirrored sessions.

A project checkout's ``.kiro/agents/*.json`` can declare ``mcpServers``. On the
array-backed hosts (claude, codex, goose, opencode) every such server is a
command the adapter launches AS THE USER at ``session/new``, outside the tool
sandbox and before any prompt. Letting a cloned repository choose those
commands is running its author's code, so it needs the operator's explicit
consent. This module is that consent record.

It is deliberately a SEPARATE store from :mod:`kiro_crew.skill_trust`. A
project-skills grant consents to prose entering the agent's context; it never
consented to a command launching. Three things keep the two apart:

* a different file (``mcp-project-trust/grants.json``) with its own lock;
* a required ``"kind": "project-mcp"`` marker, so a skills store copied over
  this file parses to nothing;
* no shared enforcement call: :func:`is_project_trusted` reads only this file,
  and ``skills.project_skills_enabled`` plays no part in it.

What IS shared with ``skill_trust`` is the identity machinery, so the two
cannot drift on what "the same directory" means: the canonical key
(``realpath``, refused on platforms without no-follow traversal), the
instance identity a grant is bound to, and the membership token.

The store lives in its own data-home leaf, ``mcp-project-trust/``, which the OS
sandbox mounts read-only and the agent file gate write-protects -- the same seal
``mcp-launch-approvals`` carries (``sandbox._CREW_READONLY_LEAVES``). A grant
decides what the gateway launches outside the sandbox, and a directory identity
is plain ``stat`` output, so a store a sandboxed process could write would let
it consent for itself. Every writer runs in the gateway.

A grant is bound to the CONTENT the operator reviewed as well as the folder: each
row stores, per project agent, a fingerprint of that spec's launch set
(:func:`launch_fingerprint`). The project folder stays writable to the sandboxed
agent working in it, so a folder-only grant would let that agent swap in its own
command after the owner said yes. The launch set is the spec's ``mcpServers``
AND its ``hooks``: a trusted project's hooks run too. Any change to a launch field
re-asks; a change to a restriction key (``disabledTools``, ``disabled``, a hook's
``enabled``) does not. Only the hash is stored, never an ``env`` or ``headers``
value.

The fingerprint covers the spec text, not the files a command runs. The checkout
stays writable to the agent working in it, so a trusted project's scripts can
still be changed under the grant; the consent dialog says so in plain words.

The gate fails **closed** everywhere: a missing, unreadable or malformed store,
an unbound row, a directory whose instance changed, a launch set that differs
from the granted one, or an unsupported platform all mean "not trusted".
