# Letting a project run its own MCP servers and hooks

A project can declare MCP servers in its own agent spec, under
`<project>/.kiro/agents/*.json` → `mcpServers`. On a Claude, Codex, Goose or
OpenCode session, each of those servers is a command that starts **as you, outside
the tool sandbox**, as soon as the session opens. So a project you just cloned
does not get to start them. On Goose and OpenCode its spec `hooks` run too, inside the
tool sandbox, and they are part of the same choice (Claude and Codex sessions do not run
spec hooks). Both stay off until you say yes for that folder.

kiro-cli sessions are not affected: kiro-cli reads the project spec itself, so the
notice is not shown when kiro-cli is your default backend.

## Turn them on for one project

> **Trust only a project whose code you'd run yourself. An agent working here can
> change that code.** A grant notices when the agent spec changes, but not when a
> script it runs (`./scripts/server.sh`, `tools/mcp.js`) is rewritten.

1. Open a chat whose project is that folder.
2. If the project declares servers, a notice appears above the message box:
   "This project declares N MCP servers. They stay off until you trust them."
3. Click **Review**. The dialog shows the folder's real path, each server's command and
   arguments, and each hook's event and command. Environment variables and headers are
   shown by name only.
4. Click **Trust and run** only if you know the project. Click **Keep them off** to
   leave things as they are.

The servers start from the **next** session in that folder.

## Turn them off again

Open **MCP** settings. The **Projects trusted to run MCP servers and hooks** list shows every
folder you trusted, including ones that no longer exist. Click **Withdraw** next to
a folder. New sessions there start without its servers.

## What stays the same

- A project's switch-offs always apply, trusted or not: `disabledTools` on a server,
  and `"disabled": true`.
- Trusting a project's **skills** is a different choice. It does not let the
  project's MCP servers run, and trusting MCP servers does not load its skills.
- Your own servers in `~/.kiro/agents` and `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` are not
  affected.

## When a grant stops matching

A grant is tied to the exact folder you reviewed. It no longer counts, and the
servers stay off, when:

- the project changes a server's command, arguments, URL, environment, headers or any
  other launch setting, or adds or edits a hook (turning tools off, muting a server or
  turning a hook off or on does not count);
- the folder is deleted and a new one is made at the same path;
- the project folder you open is a symlink;
- the grant store is unreadable or was edited by hand into a shape it does not know;
- the agent is a Markdown (`.md`) project spec, which this consent does not cover yet.

A project whose commands, arguments or settings are too long to show in full, or that
contain hidden characters (newlines, zero-width or text-direction marks), can't be
trusted: fix them first.

Grant it again from the notice if you still trust the project.

Only the dashboard owner can view, grant or withdraw these grants.
